# BIOGPT--The-chatGpt-for-life-sciences

Introduction-

In recent advancements within the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), Microsoft garnered attention with the launch of ChatGPT, an innovative chatbot developed by OpenAI, in November of the preceding year. However, a lesser-known yet equally significant unveiling by Microsoft occurred in January of the subsequent year with the introduction of BioGPT. Unlike ChatGPT, BioGPT is tailored specifically for the biomedical domain, offering a unique AI tool designed to evaluate biomedical research and provide insights into complex biomedical queries. Leveraging generative language models trained on millions of published biomedical research articles, BioGPT possesses the capability to extract relevant information, generate text, and offer answers to biomedical questions. This introduction of BioGPT signifies a pivotal step in empowering researchers with a powerful AI-driven resource for gaining fresh perspectives and enhancing biomedical research endeavors. In this paper, we delve into the development and capabilities of BioGPT, a generative pretrained Transformer language model, highlighting its potential in revolutionizing the landscape of biomedical text generation and analysis.
